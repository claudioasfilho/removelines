I'm going to talk about the simple truth in leadership in the 21st century.
In the 21st century, we need to actually look at  and what I'm actually going to encourage you to consider today  is to go back to our school days when we learned how to count.
But I think it's time for us to think about what we count.
Because what we actually count truly counts.
Let me start by telling you a little story.
This is Van Quach.
She came to this country in 1986 from Vietnam.
She changed her name to Vivian because she wanted to fit in here in America.
Her first job was at an inner city motel in San Francisco as a maid.
I happened to buy that motel about three months after Vivian started working there.
So Vivian and I have been working together for 23 years.
With the youthful idealism of a 26 year old, in 1987, I started my company and I called it Joie de Vivre, a very impractical name, because I actually was looking to create joy of life.
And this first hotel that I bought, motel, was a pay by the hour, no tell motel in the inner city of San Francisco.
As I spent time with Vivian, I saw that she had sort of a joie de vivre in how she did her work.
It made me question and curious: How could someone actually find joy in cleaning toilets for a living? So I spent time with Vivian, and I saw that she didn't find joy in cleaning toilets.
Her job, her goal and her calling was not to become the world's greatest toilet scrubber.
What counts for Vivian was the emotional connection she created with her fellow employees and our guests.
And what gave her inspiration and meaning was the fact that she was taking care of people who were far away from home.
Because Vivian knew what it was like to be far away from home.
That very human lesson, more than 20 years ago, served me well during the last economic downturn we had.
In the wake of the dotcom crash and 9/11, San Francisco Bay Area hotels went through the largest percentage revenue drop in the history of American hotels.
We were the largest operator of hotels in the Bay Area, so we were particularly vulnerable.
But also back then, remember we stopped eating French fries in this country.
Well, not exactly, of course not.
We started eating "freedom fries," and we started boycotting anything that was French.
Well, my name of my company, Joie de Vivre  so I started getting these letters from places like Alabama and Orange County saying to me that they were going to boycott my company because they thought we were a French company.
And I'd write them back, and I'd say, "What a minute.
We're not French.
We're an American company.
We're based in San Francisco." And I'd get a terse response: "Oh, that's worse." (Laughter) So one particular day when I was feeling a little depressed and not a lot of joie de vivre, I ended up in the local bookstore around the corner from our offices.
And I initially ended up in the business section of the bookstore looking for a business solution.
But given my befuddled state of mind, I ended up in the self help section very quickly.
That's where I got reacquainted with Abraham Maslow's "hierarchy of needs." I took one psychology class in college, and I learned about this guy, Abraham Maslow, as many of us are familiar with his hierarchy of needs.
But as I sat there for four hours, the full afternoon, reading Maslow, I recognized something that is true of most leaders.
One of the simplest facts in business is something that we often neglect, and that is that we're all human.
Each of us, no matter what our role is in business, has some hierarchy of needs in the workplace.
So as I started reading more Maslow, what I started to realize is that Maslow, later in his life, wanted to take this hierarchy for the individual and apply it to the collective, to organizations and specifically to business.
But unfortunately, he died prematurely in 1970, and so he wasn't really able to live that dream completely.
So I realized in that dotcom crash that my role in life was to channel Abe Maslow.
And that's what I did a few years ago when I took that five level hierarchy of needs pyramid and turned it into what I call the transformation pyramid, which is survival, success and transformation.
It's not just fundamental in business, it's fundamental in life.
And we started asking ourselves the questions about how we were actually addressing the higher needs, these transformational needs for our key employees in the company.
These three levels of the hierarchy needs relate to the five levels of Maslow's hierarchy of needs.
But as we started asking ourselves about how we were addressing the higher needs of our employees and our customers, I realized we had no metrics.
We had nothing that actually could tell us whether we were actually getting it right.
So we started asking ourselves: What kind of less obvious metrics could we use to actually evaluate our employees' sense of meaning, or our customers' sense of emotional connection with us? For example, we actually started asking our employees, do they understand the mission of our company, and do they feel like they believe in it, can they actually influence it, and do they feel that their work actually has an impact on it? We started asking our customers, did they feel an emotional connection with us, in one of seven different kinds of ways.
Miraculously, as we asked these questions and started giving attention higher up the pyramid, what we found is we created more loyalty.
Our customer loyalty skyrocketed.
Our employee turnover dropped to one third of the industry average, and during that five year dotcom bust, we tripled in size.
As I went out and started spending time with other leaders out there and asking them how they were getting through that time, what they told me over and over again was that they just manage what they can measure.
What we can measure is that tangible stuff at the bottom of the pyramid.
They didn't even see the intangible stuff higher up the pyramid.
So I started asking myself the question: How can we get leaders to start valuing the intangible? If we're taught as leaders to just manage what we can measure, and all we can measure is the tangible in life, we're missing a whole lot of things at the top of the pyramid.
So I went out and studied a bunch of things, and I found a survey that showed that 94 percent of business leaders worldwide believe that the intangibles are important in their business, things like intellectual property, their corporate culture, their brand loyalty, and yet, only five percent of those same leaders actually had a means of measuring the intangibles in their business.
So as leaders, we understand that intangibles are important, but we don't have a clue how to measure them.
So here's another Einstein quote: "Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted." I hate to argue with Einstein, but if that which is most valuable in our life and our business actually can't be counted or valued, aren't we going to spend our lives just mired in measuring the mundane? It was that sort of heady question about what counts that led me to take my CEO hat off for a week and fly off to the Himalayan peaks.
I flew off to a place that's been shrouded in mystery for centuries, a place some folks call Shangri La.
It's actually moved from the survival base of the pyramid to becoming a transformational role model for the world.
I went to Bhutan.
The teenage king of Bhutan was also a curious man, but this was back in 1972, when he ascended to the throne two days after his father passed away.
At age 17, he started asking the kinds of questions that you'd expect of someone with a beginner's mind.
On a trip through India, early in his reign as king, he was asked by an Indian journalist about the Bhutanese GDP, the size of the Bhutanese GDP.
The king responded in a fashion that actually has transformed us four decades later.
He said the following, he said: "Why are we so obsessed and focused with gross domestic product? Why don't we care more about gross national happiness?" Now, in essence, the king was asking us to consider an alternative definition of success, what has come to be known as GI'm going to talk about the simple truth in leadership in the 21st century.
In the 21st century, we need to actually look at  and what I'm actually going to encourage you to consider today  is to go back to our school days when we learned how to count.

I learned that from a maid in a motel and a king of a country.
What can you start counting today? What one thing can you start counting today that actually would be meaningful in your life, whether it's your work life or your business life? Thank you very much.
(Applause) Gle.
